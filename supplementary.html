                <h3>CAREER LADDER: Making connections</h3>
                <h4>How to network better if you're shy</h4>
                <p>Networking doesn't necessarily mean talking to hundreds of people at a conference. A few good connections are much better than meeting lots of people who you will never hear from again.</p>
                <p>Start by chatting to ex-colleagues or old friends. Ask what they are doing now and share your experiences.</p>
                <p>One common habit of shy people is to constantly apologize for everything. Apologizing all of the time looks unprofessional and shows a lack of confidence in yourself.</p>
                <p>Instead of saying sorry, remember to smile, maintain eye contact, ask questions, and, of course, exchange business cards.</p>
